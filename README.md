# svg_to_drawio
Python helper to convert SVG files into DrawIO shapes.

[DrawIO Shapes](https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/custom-shapes) are specific templates of the diagram tool [Draw IO](https://www.drawio.com/).
Color styles can be applied to them. Strokewidth can be adapted within the tool.

Simply importing SVG files into Draw IO does not allow this. For them colors and strokewidth are fixed.

Although the Draw IO XML format is similar to SVG, it has a slight different syntax and a reduced set of features.
