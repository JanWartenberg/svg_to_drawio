# TODO

- go through rest for readability
- go through rest for further tests

- normalized_to_d_path 
  - -> as API? -> provide example?
- merge_paths
  - -> as API? -> provide example?

- only leave files in "public API" / separate the rest?
  - or decide that only via `__init__.py`?

- example/tutorial: consider the drawio_shape_example to explain <save/>/<restore/>, color="gradient" in draw.io XML
